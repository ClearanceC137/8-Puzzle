# 8-Puzzle
A c++ project . In this project I try to solve an 8-Puzzle using Bread-first-Search.
The project is split into 4 parts


state of board : consists of a single string of digits and the hash symbol , hash symbol represent empty tile

Part1 - setting the board
Input: state of board
Output:Print out the board as a 3 × 3 matrix

Part2 - Implementing moves
Input: consists of two lines. The first line state of board.The second line is the
action taken, which is one of either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT.
Output: The first output line is the cost of the action. The next few lines are the resulting configuration
as a 3 × 3 matrix

Part3 -  Implementing available actions
Input: state of board
Output: Output the list of available actions

Part4 -Breadth-first search
Input - The first line is a representation of the initial state, and the second
line is the goal state.
Output: Output the cost of the optimal plan from the start to the goal state.
